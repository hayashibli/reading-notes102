## What makes a computer a computer?
Computers are everywhere and they work based on specific process
input storage processing output (4 things common to all computers were used from early years until now)
- Input : tell you computer information to do certain tasks and converts physical input to binary information.
- Storage : these information are stored in the memory.
- Processing : a computer processor (CPU) takes these information from the memory and change it using 
algorithm which is a series of commands then sends back the processed information to memory until it can be ready to result as outputs.
- Output : converts information to physical output it includes everything texts, photos, videos and may even includes signals to control a robot. Also the output of a computer can
be an input to another and vice versa.

## How computers work?
They work on the binary number digits using ones and zeroes (1001100) and it represents any number.
There are circuits and electric wires inside a computer to carry all the information in it.

## How to store or represent computer's information using electricity?
an electric wire with electricity flowing through it can be the signal can be turned on or off and this on/off state called a bit
which is the smallest piece of information can be stored by a computer. More wires mean more bits and more bits represent a more
complex information. Every input and output of a computer is a type of information that can be represented by on/off or 1/0 on 
electric signals.

* Images and videos also made by number in which Images are made out of pixels and each pixel 
has a colour and each colour is represented with numbers

* Sounds are a series of vibrations that are representred graphically by waveform and any point of the waveform can be represented
by numbers.

**Therefore, computers work from inside based on the binary number digits system and the circuits within the electric wires so
they are the backbone of how all computers input, store, process and output information.**
