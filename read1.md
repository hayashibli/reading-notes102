**Markdown and GitHub**
* Markdown language is an easy way to create webpages as you can:
1. Control the style of the text.
2. Adding links and images.
3. Listing things either in an ordered or unordered way.
This language depends on many symbols such as (*,-,#,!) thus after previewing the file on GitHub the shape of the text will change
that's why markdown is not a WYSIWYG language, you can learn more about markdown symbols [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
* GitHub is a website where you can publish webpages using jekyll theme which is a tool that convert markdown text pages into webpages with an HTML content.
After creating an account on GitHub, you can create something called **repository** with master branch in which you can add many files with **.md** or **.markdown** extensions and you can edit
and add files like you want without any problems but you should click on **commit changes** when you edit any file.
You can see the repositories in this image ![img](https://tonsky.me/blog/github-redesign/10_as-is.png)
