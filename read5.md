used to design the webpage. Inside the link elements there are attributes like
- href: specify the path of the file.
- type: specify the type of the document that is linked to.
- rel: specify the relationship between th HTML and the file linked to so in case of 
linking CSS file the rel will be (stylesheet).

 to most child elements.
