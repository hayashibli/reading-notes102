# Loops

These check a condition if the result is true then the if block code will run and it will keep running until the result is false.
There are three common types of loops:
- While loop: used when you want run a code for unspecific number of times.
ex; while(i<10){}
- For loop: used when you want to run a code for specific number of times. It consists of; initialization, condition and update.
ex; for (var a=0 ; a<10 ; a++){}
- Do while: similar to while loop but it differ in the structure of the statement.
