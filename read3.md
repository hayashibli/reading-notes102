# Git Tutorial
## **Version Control**  
This system enables us to revisit different versions of files that we make a change into it by recording changes.
### There are 3 types of Version Control
1. Local VC : which includes one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.
2. Centralized VC : which includes a single server storing all the changes and file versions
3. Distributed VC : in case the CVS goes down, collaborators cannot work with each other 
on a file or save changes and new versions so DVC allows clients to create mirrored or copied repositories.

## **Git**
Take snapshots of the data to store it and saving any change called commit
so any change you make is tracked by git and there are 3 states for git files: **committed, modified and staged**
users can use third-party tools  with git even it includes (GUI) tools.

So we should 
- install git
- make an account with username and pass
- a text editor should be installed to be able to work with git
- we can clone any repos from the github website 
Workflow

All files in git are either:
 
* Tracked 
Which can be modified, unmodified, or staged.
(they were in the last snapshot)
* Untracked
Untracked files are not in the last snapshot.
