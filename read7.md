these words together to create instructions. 

## Expressions
They result in a single value and there are two types:
- Expression that assign a value to a variable.
- Expression that use two or more value to give single value.

## Operators
Which are things that the expressions rely on and they allow to create one value from one or more values.
* Types:
- Assignment operators: assign a value to a variable.
- Arithmatic operators: perform basic math.
- String operators: combine two strings.
- Comparison operators: compare two values and the result will be true/false.
- Logical operators: combine expressions and result will also be true/false.

## Functions
A block of code which let you to group series of statments to perform a task. When you want to declare a function you give it 
*parameters* and they act as variables inside it. The values inside parantheses are called arguments.
You can repeate the code in function as many as you want.
There are two ways to declare functions:
- Declaration
- Expression
A function with no name is called an anonymous function.
Types of variable:
- Variable scope: which is inside the function statement.
- Variable global: which is outside the function statment.
