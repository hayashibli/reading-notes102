### The Difference Between Text Editors andÂ IDEs 
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
### Command line or terminal
is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard
and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

### The shell,bash

*Shell* is a part of the system that defines how the terminal will act after running commands.There are various shells 
available but the most common one is called *bash* which stands for Bourne again shell.
 
### Shortcuts
They save you from making silly mistakes and help you to modify your codes easily just by moving using arrows.

### Basic navigation
- pwd : stands for print working directory and it shows where are we currently.
- ls : stands for list; it lists the contents of a directory
- cd : stands for changing directory so it moves to another directory and if you write cd without any arrgument it will go to the homepage.

### Activities
- /etc - Stores config files for the system.
- /var/log - Stores log files for various system programs. (You may not have permission to look at everything in this directory. Don't let that stop you exploring though. A few error messages never hurt anyone.)
- /bin - The location of several commonly used programs (some of which we will learn about in the rest of this tutorial.
- /usr/bin - Another location for programs on the system.

### paths

There are 2 types of paths we can use:
- Absolute : specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory and
 you can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / )
- Relative :specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system and 
they will not begin with a slash.

### Files

- file : obtain information about what type of file or directory is.
- ls -a : list the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
